This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an unusual file structure or dependencies.  For example, if you have a file named `package.json` in a subdirectory that's not the root of your project, or if you have conflicting versions of dependencies, Expo CLI might encounter issues during installation or build processes. The error messages are often unclear, varying widely depending on the specific root cause.  One common symptom is an abrupt halt in the build process without much information about where the problem originates.
