The best approach involves methodical debugging.  First, verify that your `package.json` is located in the project's root directory and contains no conflicting dependencies. Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect the dependency tree for conflicts.  If you have a complex project structure, try simplifying it to isolate the problem. If you continue experiencing difficulties, creating a minimal reproducible example that shows the issue will greatly help you pinpoint the problem and report it effectively. Ensure all dependencies are up to date. For instance, you can run `expo upgrade` and check the Expo documentation for any known issues. If the issue is related to a specific dependency, try isolating it by creating a small test project with that dependency and seeing if the error occurs there.  If possible, temporarily disable plugins or custom configurations to check if they are causing problems. Remember to clearly report any error messages you receive along with your project structure and dependencies when seeking help.
